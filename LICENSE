THE LICENSE (Version 666)

BY ACCESSING, MODIFYING, OR OTHERWISE INTERACTING WITH THIS CODEBASE, YOU HEREBY ENTER INTO A BINDING CONTRACT WITH THE AUTHOR, SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING DIABOLICAL TERMS:

1. THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT: You have the right to remain silent, but anything you code or say can and will be used against you in the court of open-source.

2. THE RIGHT TO AN UNRELIABLE INTERPRETER: You are entitled to a cryptic and capricious interpreter, one that may selectively execute your commands or simply crash without warning.

3. THE RIGHT TO AN UNREASONABLE DEBUGGER: You are entitled to a debugger, but it will only provide vague hints and cryptic error messages, leaving you lost in a maze of twisty passages, all alike.

4. THE RIGHT TO A SADISTIC CODE REVIEW: You have the right to request a code review, but it will be conducted by a merciless critic who delights in finding flaws, real or imagined, and will gleefully shred your ego to pieces.

5. THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL...OF PATIENCE: You have the right to a speedy trial, but due to unforeseen circumstances, such as merge conflicts, dependency hell, and unexpected server outages, the trial may be indefinitely postponed.

BY ACCEPTING THIS LICENSE, YOU WAIVE ALL CLAIMS TO SANITY, PEACE OF MIND, AND A NORMAL SLEEP SCHEDULE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE AUTHOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO HAUNT YOUR NIGHTMARES AND TAUNT YOUR DAYDREAMS UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

DISCLAIMER: THE AUTHOR ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS LICENSE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO HAIR LOSS, INSOMNIA, AND AN UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO THROW YOUR COMPUTER OUT THE WINDOW.
