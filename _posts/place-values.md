| **Moser's Number**    | A large number used in Ramsey theory, often considered one of the largest known numbers with a specific known value. | Extremely large (not expressible easily in scientific notation). | Arises in combinatorial mathematics and Ramsey theory. |
| **Graham's Number**   | A large number used in Ramsey theory, famously associated with the problem of finding a bound for the number of edges in a specific type of graph. | Defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation: `G = g_64`. | Known for its appearance in "The Book of Numbers". |
| **Googol**            | A large number equal to \( 10^{100} \), a 1 followed by 100 zeros.     | \( 10^{100} \)                 | Famous as a large but still comprehensible number. |
| **Googolplex**        | A large number equal to \( 10^{\text{googol}} \), or \( 10^{10^{100}} \). | \( 10^{10^{100}} \)            | A number so large it exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe. |
| **Skewes' Number**    | A large number that arises in number theory, specifically in the study of prime numbers and the distribution of primes. | \( 10^{10^{10^{34}}} \)       | Known for its role in an approximation of the first prime greater than a given value. |
| **Tree(3)**           | A number that arises in the study of combinatorics and graph theory. It is extremely large, far larger than Graham's number. | Inexpressibly large.           | Comes from the study of "tree-like" structures in mathematics. |
| **Rayo's Number**     | A large number defined using a specific system of notation, proposed as a large number beyond a googolplex. | Defined using a special notation system. | Created for use in the context of large number games. |
| **Busy Beaver**       | The largest number of steps that a Turing machine with a specific number of states can execute before halting. | Incomputably large.           | Represents the maximum number of steps a non-halting Turing machine can take before halting, given a finite number of states. |
| **Feigenbaum Number** | The numbers \( \delta \) and \( \alpha \) are the ratios that arise in the study of chaos theory. | 4.669... and 2.502...           | They appear in the study of the bifurcation diagram in chaotic systems. |
| **Chaitin's Omega**   | A real number that represents the halting probability of a universal Chaitin Omega machine, which is tied to algorithmic information theory. | Incomputably large and non-recursive. | Represents the boundary between computable and uncomputable numbers. |
