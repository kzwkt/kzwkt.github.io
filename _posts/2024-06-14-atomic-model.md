Leucippus of Miletus (5th century bce) originated atomic philosophy

his disciple  Democritus of Abdera named building blocks of matter atomos, meaning literally “indivisible,” about 430 bce
suggested sphere of elements (earth,air,fire and water)

aristotle disagreed with this philosophy and thus this theory got ignored for 2k years. 

Antoine Lavoisier redefined an element as a substance which scientists could not decompose into simpler substances by experimentation
brought an end to the ancient idea of the elements of matter being fire, earth, air, and water, which had no experimental support
he showed that water can be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen, which in turn he could not decompose into anything simpler, thereby proving these are elements
defined the law of conservation of mass

 In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli postulated that the pressure of gases and heat were both caused by the underlying motion of molecules. 

law of definite proportions, established by the French chemist Joseph Proust in 1797
 if a compound is broken down into its constituent chemical elements, then the masses of those constituents will always have 
 the same proportions by weight, regardless of the quantity or source of the original compound. 
 This definition distinguished compounds from mixtures.

 
John dalton 
Thomas Thomson, who published an explanation of Dalton's theory in his book A System of Chemistry in 1807
book A New System of Chemical Philosophy (Part I, 1808; Part II, 1810) 
togather with Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac of France and Amedeo Avogadro  provided experimental foundation of atomic chemistry

-  All matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms.
-  Atoms are indestructible and resist changes.
  based on law of conservation of mass in late 1700
-  all atoms of an element are identical in shape, size, and mass.
-  they combine in small whole-number ratios to form what are now called molecules.

dalton studied data to notice  law of multiple proportions , finding element combines with other elements in multiples of a basic quantity. 


 Amedeo Avogadro
 Avogadro proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules
 (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles does not affect the volume that it occupies)


 Mendeleev's periodic table
 Dmitrii Mendeleev, Russian chemist and inventor  noticed that when he arranged the elements in a row according to their atomic weights, there was a certain periodicity to them.
 noble gases were not known back when Mendeleev devised his table
 In 1913, Henry Moseley discovered that atoms of each element, when excited, emit X-rays at a frequency proportional to the element's position on the adjusted periodic table

Sir Joseph John (J.J) Thomson
1897 , he discoverd electron , atom no longer homogeneous particle and has sub structure discoverd.
evidence in favor “plum-pudding” model of atomic structure first proposed by Lord Kelvin. 
- there are pockets of negative charges within the sphere of the atom

experiment
A Crookes tube is a sealed glass container in which two electrodes are separated by a vacuum.
When a voltage is applied across the electrodes, cathode rays are generated, creating a glowing patch where they strike the 
glass at the opposite end of the tube. 
Through experimentation, Thomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by electric fields and magnetic fields, 
which meant that these rays were not a form of light but were composed of very light charged particles, and their charge was negative. 
Thomson called these particles "corpuscles". He measured their mass-to-charge ratio to be several orders of magnitude smaller 
than that of the hydrogen atom, the smallest atom. This ratio was the same regardless of what the electrodes were made of and 
what the trace gas in the tube was
positive ions created by electrolysis or X-ray radiation had mass-to-charge ratios that varied depending on the material of the electrodes and the type of 
gas in the reaction chamber, indicating they were different kinds of particles

In 1898, Thomson measured the charge on ions to be roughly 6 × 10-10 electrostatic units (2 × 10-19 Coulombs)
In 1899, he showed that negative electricity created by ultraviolet light landing on a metal (known now as the photoelectric effect) has the same mass-to-charge ratio as cathode rays
he showed that electron's mass was 0.0014 times that of hydrogen ions.
concluded they must be the basic particles of electricity since they are so light but has so much charge

In 1906, Robert A. Millikan and Harvey Fletcher performed the oil drop experiment in which they measured the charge of an electron to be about -1.6 × 10-19, a value now defined as -1 e


 Rutherford model
in 1911 a former student of Thomson’s, New Zealand-born British physicist Ernest Rutherford, 
with other scientists, performed  experiment that led to the overturning of Thomson’s model

 alpha particle experiment
aimed alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and then recorded the location of the alpha particle with a fluorescent screen
- the majority of the alpha particles passed through the gold foil as if the foil was not there.
- a very small number of these alpha particles deflected at angles from the initial path
- some of the alpha particles even bouncing back along the initial path.

conclusion :  there must be a small, highly dense core of matter in an atom off which the alpha particles were bouncing. 
theorized that this atomic nucleus was positively charged and surmised that the electrons orbited around it.

 Bohr model
at the beginning of the 20th century, when Max Planck and Albert Einstein postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as quanta (singular, quantum)
quantum model of Arthur Erich Haas in 1910 and the 1912 John William Nicholson quantum atomic model that quantized angular momentum as h/2π
  
in 1913, student of Rutherford , bohr proposed his quantized shell model of the atom 
The motion of the electrons in the Rutherford model was unstable because, according to 
classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory, any charged particle moving on a curved path emits electromagnetic radiation; 
thus, the electrons would lose energy and spiral into the nucleus.

- The energy and angular momentum  of an electron depends on the size of the orbit (radius) and is lower for smaller orbits
- each orbit has a different energy level associated with it, as the distance from the nucleus determines forces acting on the electrons in the various orbits, or shells
- Radiation can occur only when the electron jumps from one orbit to another
- energy can be absorbed by electrons to move from a lower energy orbit to a higher energy orbit and that they release energy when moving from higher to lower energy orbits

by the early 1920s Bohr’s model seemed to be a dead end, as efforts to generalize the model(explain spectral line) to multielectron atoms had proved futile 
it couldnt explain multiplication of spectral lines on applying magnetic field
quantum atomic model

In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—have an associated wave

in 1925, Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated  Pauli exclusion principle for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin–statistics theorem of 1940. 
which states states that two or more identical particles with half-integer spins (i.e. fermions) cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state within a system that obeys the laws of quantum mechanics.

In 1926 Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger used mathematical equations to describe the probability of finding electrons 
in specific positions 

in 1927 Werner Heisenberg introduced uncertainty principle .A consequence of describing particles as waveforms rather than points is that it is mathematically impossible to calculate with precision both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time. 

In 1928, Walter Bothe observed that beryllium emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles


In 1932 English physicist James Chadwick discovered a neutral particle of approximately the same mass as the proton and located in the nucleus of the atom called neutron

modern atomic model
 In the 1960s subatomic particles called quarks were found
  The proton is made up of two up quarks, each of which has a positive charge 2/3 that of the electron, and one down quark, which has a negative charge 1/3 that of the electron. 
  The neutron is made up of one up quark and two down quarks and thus has no charge.
