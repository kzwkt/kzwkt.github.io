| **Paranthropus aethiopicus**      | ~2.7 mya                     | ~2.3 mya                   | Known for robust cranial features adapted for chewing tough vegetation.       |
| **Paranthropus boisei**           | ~2.3 mya                     | ~1.2 mya                   | "Nutcracker Man"; known for powerful jaws and a diet of hard plant materials. |
| **Paranthropus robustus**         | ~2 mya                       | ~1.2 mya                   | Similar to P. boisei, with adaptations for chewing tough foods.               |
| **Homo habilis**                  | ~2.4 mya                     | ~1.5 mya                   | Earliest known member of the genus *Homo*, associated with simple stone tools. |
| **Homo erectus**                  | ~2 mya                       | ~110,000 years ago         | First hominin to leave Africa; advanced tool use and fire control.            |
| **Homo heidelbergensis**          | ~600,000 years ago           | ~200,000 years ago         | Likely common ancestor of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans.        |
| **Homo neanderthalensis**         | ~400,000 years ago           | ~40,000 years ago          | Closest extinct relatives to modern humans; adapted to cold environments.     |
| **Denisovans**                    | ~400,000 years ago           | ~50,000 years ago          | A close relative of Neanderthals; known primarily from genetic evidence.       |
