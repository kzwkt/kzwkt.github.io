xt stands for "exact topic," and it specifies the type of identifier.

urn:btih: is a standard identifier for BitTorrent info hashes.

info_hash is the unique SHA1 hash of the torrentâ€™s metadata (file structure, file names, etc.), which is the key piece of information needed to find and identify the content.

dn=filename (optional):

    dn stands for "display name." This  field specifies the name of the file or content, which is useful for users to identify the torrent.
    
? separates the base URL from the parameters, and & separates multiple parameters
